# DML-Simulations
Files to reproduce analyses running the agent-based model in the Des Moines Lobe. This analysis will be featured in a paper currently (12-1-2021) in review.

Files:

**Working Notes - Des Moines Lobe Milkweed Augmentation Simulations.docx**:  my personal working notes on developing and running these simulations

**DML Model Runs and Parameters for GitHub.xlsx**:  list of model runs, parameters, etc. 

**Workflow for Running Monarch Model using Slurm on ISU HPC machines.docx**:  my workflow for running the model on Iowa State University High Performance Computing services

Shapefiles for Scenarios 1, 2, and 3:

**Spatial_Join_DML4_Counties5_UTMLL.shp**

**Spatial_Join_DML4_Counties5_UTMS2LL.shp**

**Spatial_Join_DML4_Counties5_UTMS3LL.shp**

The shapefiles for are ~400 GB each. Contact me if you need copies. 

Simulation output files (e.g., **CumEggsPerZone.2021.Mar.20.10_57_04.txt**) are ~5.6 TB. Contact me if you need copies. 

**HabArea and EggsLaid1-3.xlsx**:  summary of the model output - area of each landcover type in the DML and each county, eggs laid per each landcover type per county, and summary figures
